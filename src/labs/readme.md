Synopsis

This program takes input from the user, both the price of the item and the price
paid.  The program then calculates the remainder between what the purchase price
of the item was and the amount tendered by the customer.  The program then takes
the remainder and determines how many bills of each type and coins of each type
should be given back to the customer.
